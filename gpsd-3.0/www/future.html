<p>This page is our roadmap for future features and releases.</p>

<h2 id="new_protocol">The new GPSD protocol</h2>

<p>2.90 has shipped, and with it the redesign of GPSD's wire protocol.
While this brings many benefits (including, immediately, the ability
to interpret and report on the output of marine AIS receivers) it
poses some significant deployment challenges as well.</p>

<p>Over the next few releases we're going to be preoccupied with 
<a href="protocol-transition.html">managing the transition to the
new protocol.</a>. See that document for our tentative release schedule:</p>

<p>For more on specific tasks planned for upcoming releases, see our
<a href="TODO">TODO file</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Changing hosting sites</h2>

<p>We're presently (April 2010) hosted at <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de">berlios.de</a>, but find that it
has become extremely flaky of late (logins failing due to broken SSL
certs is the most recent symptom).  We plan to change sites some time
in 2010.</p>

<h2 id="dbus">Delegating DBUS support to geoclue</h2>

<p>We're going to stop shipping DBUS notifications directly at some point.  
<b>Note: This is no longer a near-term prospect, as geoclue is reported
not sufficiently stable to bear the weight.</b></p>

<p>The reason for this is <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue">GeoClue</a>.
GeoClue is an aggregator that takes geolocation-related information
from provider programs, including <code>gpsd</code>, and publishes
it on DBUS.</p>

<p>For us, DBUS support is a dusty backwater in our code.  We don't
track what the DBUS community is doing or expecting.  Our devteam
worries about version skew between GPSD's DBUS transmissions and
client apps, and wouldn't have the knowledge base to fix that quickly
if it happened.</p>

<p>The GeoClue team, on the other hand, loves DBUS and specializes
in it. We think it's probably best for both projects if they take
data from us and handle the DBUS publishing job for us.</p>

<h2 id="api_cleanup">Client API cleanup</h2>

<p>This will happen after 2.95 but before 3.0.</p>

<p>The client API has some historical baggage, unfortunate naming, and
scar tissue in it.  At some point we're going to bump the API major
version number to 5 and make the following changes:<p>

<ul>
<li>MAXCHANNELS will increase so we can handle a GPS + GLONASS 
constellation.  This has become a production issue because of the
Geostar Geos 1M. (Done in 2.96~dev.)</p> 

<li><p>gps_open_r() will be renamed to gps_open(). The existing
gps_open() will go away. (Done in 2.96~dev.)</p></li>

<li><p>The 'waiting' and 'buffer' members of privdata will move into
the public part of gps.h. (Done in 2.96~dev.)</p></li>

<li><p>gps_set_raw_hook() will be removed. Instead, clients will simply
be able to look at the packet buffer directly. (Of course, this is
only recommended when the PACKET_SET flag is up.) (Done in 2.96~dev.)</p></li>

<li><p>gps_poll() will be renamed to gps_read(). (Done in 2.96~dev.)</p></li>

<li><p>The message 24 structure may be split into part A and B so these
are in effect separate messages.</p>
</ul>

<p>Client API users will have the API_MAJOR_VERSION symbol available to
conditionalize their code so it will work with any version.</p>
