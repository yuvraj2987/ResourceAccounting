This subdirectory contains the web pages for the berlios.de repository.

To upload them after modifying, run "./upload'.  You must have xmlto,
the docbook DTD (Ver 4.1.2) and asciidoc (Ver 8.5.1+) installed for
this to work.

Note: The PDFs on the site are not in the code repository, they'd
just bulk it up.  Be careful not to delete them.
