The repo directory contains the git configuration files and hooks as
used at berlios. Here follows a short description of the files and
what they do:

description: Description of the project as displayed by gitweb/cgit.

config: Repository configuration, including config details for the
        hooks.

hooks/acl.sh: see hooks/update

hooks/ciabot.py: see hooks/update

hooks/post-receive: This script is run after receive-pack has accepted a
                    pack and the repository has been updated.
                    Currently passes stdin to post-receive-email.sh
                    which mails out commit messages to the commit
                    mailing list. See the head of post-receive-email.sh
                    for a documentation of the config options for the
                    hook.

hooks/post-receive-email.sh: see hooks/post-receive

hooks/post-update: Runs after the update hook. Executes
                   git update-server-info
                   to update the auxiliary info file to help dumb
                   servers (needed to clone via http)

hooks/update: This script does some sanity checks on the pushed commits
              before accepting them, see the description on top of the
              file for details. It also runs hooks/acl.sh, which is a
              berlios specific script to set/update acls on the
              repository - usually such a script should not be
              necessary at all. In case all checks were passed,
              hooks/ciabot.sh is called to show all commits in #gpsd.

The executable script "upload" can be used to update the repo copies with
files from this directory.  Give it arguments to upload specified filenames,
for example

    upload config

uploads the config file. With no arguments, uploads config and all hook scripts
under hooks/ directory.
