# The bard lives inside a Gavia AUV <http://www.gavia.is/>, which was
# placed in the parking log of a university laboratory for the capture
# of this data. It was completely stationary. Also, this sample
# contains strings that indicate the date. 
#
# The contents of the Transport header tell the gpsd test framework to
# ship the file to the subordinate gpsd via IP datagrams.  The source
# is passed in as a udp:// URL.
